Notes

The **Schema.org Blueprint Export module** allows non-technical/site builders,
including information architects, to understand how Drupal content types and 
fields are mapped to Schema.org types and properties.

Conversely, this module could provide the ability to reimport the exported CSV 
data and update the mappings and mapping sets.
