NBW is a nonprofit that provides educational, recreational, and career-building opportunities for youth through bicycling; it also promotes cycling as a healthy, affordable, and environmentally-friendly form of transportation.<br />
        Bike Church is made possible by volunteers, known as facilitators, who are here to help you fix your bike and provide used parts at a reasonable cost. All income made during Bike Church goes directly to NBW programs and helps us keep the doors open. If possible, please donate $5-10 each time you come to use our space and tools, and please help us with a chore before you leave!</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
        <br />
        The Rules of Bike Church:<br />
        <br />
        1. Basic shop tools will be assigned to you; if you require more advanced shop tools, please ask a facilitator.<br />
        <br />
        2. Parts cost money. If you require parts for your bike and you get them from our shop, then you must pay. Please ask a facilitator for prices and write them on your sales receipt.<br />
        <br />
        3. Before you pay at the register, a facilitator must check in your tools and initial your sales receipt.<br />
        <br />
        4. In exchange for using our shop and tools, please complete one chore before you leave the shop. Thanks!
